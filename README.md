# Overview
This repository contains all the code and data needed to design and implement a Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller for an autonomous vehicle to successfully maneuver around a complex track which has lots sharp turns.

The full details of the project implementation (developed in C++) and the design of the PID controller can be found [in this report](https://github.com/wafarag/Track-Maneuvering-using-PID-Control/blob/master/PID-Report.pdf).

## Running the Code
All the source code of the project is available [here](https://github.com/wafarag/Track-Maneuvering-using-PID-Control/tree/master/src).

This repository includes as well some [testing](https://github.com/wafarag/Track-Maneuvering-using-PID-Control/blob/master/PID-Testing-Results.rtf) and [results files](https://github.com/wafarag/Track-Maneuvering-using-PID-Control/blob/master/Results.txt).
